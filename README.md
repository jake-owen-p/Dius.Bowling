# Dius Bowling

## Setup

`npm i`

## Run

`npm run test`

### Approach

Followed a TDD approach, went in the order:
- Basic rolls, simple addition
- Spares
- Strikes
- Mixture of all three

### Future

Ran out of the 2 hours allotted time - given more time:
- Would not store the rolls under a 'frames' data structure (array of arrays) and would instead use a flat array storing all rolls
